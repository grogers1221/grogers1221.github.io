# About Me

## My Interests
I like playing video games. One of my favorites is **Teamfight Tactics**. It has a lot of cute characters and fun gameplay. I also enjoy playing **Dress to Impress** on Roblox. It is a very fun fashion game with a lot of room to play with. I love doing makeup and cosplay off my own as well.
## Websites I Reccomend
- [Roblox](www.roblox.com) - I love using Roblox to find new and fun games to play in my spare time.
- [YouTube](www.youtube.com) - I use YouTube frequently to keep up with trends and as a comfort mechanism. Putting videos on in the background can help me go to sleep.
